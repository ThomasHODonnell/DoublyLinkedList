# Doubly Linked List Project
__This project was my second programming project of CSC 1254.__

In this program, I completed the Linked List Class. The Node Class was given, and the main was used in coorespondance with a python script submission to input test strings as cases through an autograding system. I recieved 160/160 + 40/40 bonus points. 

__INFO:__
* This program cannot be ran with inputs from a user, as it is setup to accept inputs from an auto grader.
